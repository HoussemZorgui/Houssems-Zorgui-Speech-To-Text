### 🚀 **Project Description**

The app **𝙷𝙾𝚄𝚂𝚂𝙴𝙼_𝚉𝙾𝚁𝙶𝚄𝙸_𝚂𝙿𝙴𝙴𝙲𝙷 _𝚃𝙾 _𝚃𝙴𝚇𝚃** allows users to communicate with an AI chatbot using both voice and text commands. Through the integration of **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, and **OpenAI GPT** API, the app provides a smooth, interactive experience.

### **Key Features**:
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts user’s speech to text for easy interaction.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Reads the AI-generated response back to the user.
- **AI Chatbot**: Uses **OpenAI GPT** to generate responses in real-time.
- **Simple Interface**: Text field and microphone button to easily communicate with the app.

### **Why This Project?**
This project was developed as part of my personal initiative to explore and master **voice technologies**, **artificial intelligence**, and **native mobile development** in **Kotlin**. By integrating powerful APIs like **Google Speech API** and **OpenAI GPT**, I aimed to create a seamless experience for users to interact with the app via both voice and text.
